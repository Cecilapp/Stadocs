# Getting Started

## Creating a new project

First download [_Statidocs_ current archive](https://codeload.github.com/Cecilapp/statidocs/zip/refs/heads/main).

Then _Statidocs_ is a theme built on top of [Cecil](https://cecil.app):

```bash
# download Cecil
curl -LO https://cecil.app/cecil.phar
```

Finally you can preview your documentation website:

```bash
# build and serve locally
php cecil.phar serve
```
