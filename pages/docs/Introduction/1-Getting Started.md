# Getting Started

:::important
**WIP**  
Statidocs is still in development.
If something thatâ€™s not working, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Cecilapp/statidocs/issues/new/choose).

## Creating a new project

Statidocs is a documentation theme built on top of [Cecil](https://cecil.app).

You can create a new Statidocs project using the following commands:

```sh
curl -LO https://cecil.app/cecil.phar
php cecil.phar serve
```

This will create a new [project directory](page:docs/guides/project-structure).

:::tip
**Demo**  
Try Statidocs on GitHub Pages: [cecilapp.github.io/statidocs/](https://cecilapp.github.io/statidocs/).
