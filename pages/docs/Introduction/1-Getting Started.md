# Getting Started

:::important
**Work in progress**  
_Statidocs_ is still in development. If something thatâ€™s not working, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Cecilapp/statidocs/issues/new/choose).
:::

## Creating a new project

First download [_Statidocs_ current archive](https://codeload.github.com/Cecilapp/statidocs/zip/refs/heads/main).

Then _Statidocs_ is a theme built on top of [Cecil](https://cecil.app):

```bash
# download Cecil
curl -LO https://cecil.app/cecil.phar
```

Finally you can preview your documentation website:

```bash
# build and serve locally
php cecil.phar serve
```
